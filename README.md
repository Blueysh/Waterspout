# Waterspout
A template for Spigot plugins that includes useful libraries to help you get started.

## Get Started with Waterspout
To get started, clone the repository to a location where you can edit it. Afterwards, **refactor all packages to your group and artifact ids.** Be sure to also edit `pom.xml` and `plugin.yml` to match the ids. After that, happy coding!

## Starter Code
Waterspout includes a main plugin class, logging class, command class, and listener class. You can expand upon these classes by following their general structure.

## Included Libraries
Waterspout includes libraries apart from the Spigot API to make developing a plugin easier.

- [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org)
- [@joeecodes' Plugin-Framework fork](https://github.com/joeecodes/Plugin-Framework)
